    "## Assignment 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we construct **dense neural networks** for classifying images from the `MNIST` dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. The MNIST database consists of a set of 70,000 small (28x28 pixel) grayscale images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. \n",
    "\n",
    ">In **EXPERIMENTS 1 to 3**, we consider `dense neural network` models with one hidden layer. We start with one node in this hidden layer and progressively increase the number of (hidden) nodes in the layer until we find the \"best\" model in Experiment 3.\n",
    "\n",
    " But our goal in these `three` experiments is *not only* to find the \"best\" `dense neural network` model with one hidden but *also* to explore what the node(s) in the hidden layer are \"detecting\" and what their outputs (i.e. `activation values`) contribute to the final classification of an image. These are examples of intrinsic `global explanations` and `local explanations` , respectively, as described in this recent survey article: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241703-techniques-for-interpretable-machine-learning/fulltext\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine what the hidden node is \"detecting\" we use gradient descent to find a visual pattern that maximizes the activation value of the hidden node, i.e. the visual pattern that the hidden node is maximally responsive to. In this case, the exercise is probably not very insightful. But in `Assignment 2`  we will repeat this analysis with \"clusters of nodes\" (`convnet filters`) in `convolutional neural network` models. By the examining the patterns that each convnet filter is maximally responsive (but also by visualizing the convnet activations for particular test images) we should be able to determine what (some of) the filters in the `CCN` model are up to. The (activation values of the) hidden nodes (actually, groups of hidden nodes corresponding or *convnet filters*) can be visualized in various ways to show what \"features\" (edges, texture, etc.) of the input images they capture.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In **EXPERIMENT 4** we use PCA decomposition to reduce the number of dimensions of our training set of 28x28 dimensional MNIST images from 784 to 154 (with 95% of training images variance lying along these components). We also reduce the number of dimensions of 'best' model from `Experiment 3` to 154 inputs nodes and train it on the new lower dimensional data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">In **EXPERIMENT 5** we use a Random Forest classifier to get the relative importance of the 784 features (pixels) of the 28x28 dimensional images in training set of MNIST images and select the top 70 features (pixels). We train our 'best' `dense neural network` using these 70 features and compare its performance to the the `dense neural network` models from EXPERIMENTS 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are more details for the first `three` experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **EXPERIMENT 1**: Our `dense neural network` will consist of 784 input nodes, a hidden layer with `1 node` and 10 output nodes (corresponding to the 10 digits). We use `mnist.load_data()` to get the 70,000 images divided into a set of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. We hold back 5,000 of the 60,000 training images for validation. After training the model, we group the 60,000 `activation values` of the hidden node for the (original) set of training images by the 10 predicted classes and visualize these sets of values using a `boxplot`. We expect the overlap between the range of values in the \"boxes\" to be minimal. In addition, we find the pattern that maximally activates the hidden node as a \"warm up\" exercise for similar analysis we will perform on `CNN` models in `Assignment 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **EXPERIMENT 2**: This time our `dense neural network` will have 784 input nodes, a hidden layer with `2 nodes` and 10 output nodes (corresponding to the 10 digits). For each of the 60,000 images, the output of the two hidden nodes are plotted using a `scatterplot`. We color code the points according to which of the 10 classes the the output of the two nodes predicts. Ideally, just like in `EXPERIMENT 1`, the color clusters should have very little overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: For EXPERIMENTS 1 & 2 we also perform the following additional tasks:\n",
    "> 1. We use Matplotlib to create 2 plots--displaying the training and validation loss (resp. accuracy) for each (training) epoch side by side.\n",
    "> 2. For each model we obtain the confusion matrix and use it to display sample images of true vs false positives and negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **EXPERIMENT 3**: Students can experiment with more hidden nodes (in the hidden layer) to obtain the `best` model. This `final` model will be used in EXPERIMENTS 4 & 5.\n",
